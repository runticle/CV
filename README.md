<h4 align=center>Full-Stack Software Developer</h4>

Since graduating from Makers Academy at the start of 2019 I have been working in a team of developers at LeSalon; a beauty-at-home service providing on demand services to clients in London. Since joining, we have implemented a huge architectural refactor of the React-Native apps, and written well over 1000 tests whilst releasing some major features.

I have a strong aptitude for picking up new technologies while my background in engineering has equipped me with a high level of technical knowledge, a natural problem solving skill-set and an eagerness to learn. I am particularly passionate about cryptocurrencies and other exciting emerging technology and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge as a developer.

- Jest, Mocha, RSpec, Cypress

## Skills

**Fast Learner** <br>
- Working at at fast-growing startup has required me to pick up new technologies in very little time. I rapidly learnt node js at the start and more recently Hugo, which we have used to rebuild the marketing website.
- Whilst building a Facebook Clone during Makers Academy, we were tasked to rebuild the frontend in React - a new language to us at the time. I picked up the language very quickly and within a week could fluently build React components and manage data flow with Redux.

**Teamwork**
- Have continued to use Agile processes at LeSalon having been exposed to them at Makers Academy. Working as such we have managed to increase our relative speed from 2 at the start to over 10 points per dev per day, massively increasing our overall output for the company.
- I have captained both Football and Korfball teams during my time at School and University, with the notable improvement of the Korfball team throughout my years involved a particularly proud achievement of mine.

**Motivated**
- In 2014 I set up a viable business by finding profitable arbitrage opportunities whilst minimising any fees incurred through the banking system. The company was profiting Â£3k/month.
- This passion led to the self-taught development of a website to broker Bitcoin built in php, html and JavaScript in a couple of months.

**Project Management**
- Managed teams of up to 15 people on major construction sites in London
- Worked together with clients, design teams, on-site tradesmen and other contractors
- Managed acoustic projects on my own from the design phase to completion during my time at Emtec.

**Creative** <br>
- Having no design team at LeSalon, it is up to the Dev Team to design the app and website. Furthermore, we are given the freedom to engineer our own solutions to problems we face. I particularly enjoyed designing a solution for geocoding our users' addresses, which we use to send relevant offers of work to our clients.  
- In my previous role as an Acoustic Engineer, I would often have to come up with bespoke designs to reduce the noise levels of domestic and commercial equipment, often with strict requirements such as space restrictions.

**Curious** <br>
- Have always been curious to know how things work and as a child I was always designing and building things at home. This curiosity has led me to study Mechanical Engineering and Acoustic Engineering at University level, and then Programming at Makers Academy.   

## Experience

**LeSalon Beauty** (February 2019 - Present)

- Worked both in teams and individually on a wide array of projects.
- Willfully worked accross the stack on two websites, two apps and an api. 
- Liaised with customers and therapists alike to develop meaningful features bespoke to their needs.
